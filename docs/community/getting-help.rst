Getting help
============

Didn't find a solution to your problem the WEKO3 documentation? Here's how
you can get in touch with other users and developers:

.. rubric:: Forum/Knowledge base

- https://

Ask questions or browse answers to exsiting questions.

.. rubric:: Chatroom

- https://

Probably the fastest way to get a reply is to join our chatroom. Here most
developers and maintainers of WEKO3 hangout during their regular working
hours.

.. rubric:: GitHub

- https://

If you have feature requests or want to report potential bug, you can do it by
opening an issue in one of the individual WEKO3 module repositories. In each
repository there is a ``MAINTAINERS`` file in the root, which lists the who
is maintaining the module.
