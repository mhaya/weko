Governance
==========
WEKO3 is governed by National Institute of Informatics for the benefit of the community.
National Institute of Informatics strives to make WEKO3 a collaborative,
open and transparent project to ensure that everyone can contribute and have their say
on the directions of the project.

WEKO3 governance is in general informal and we try to strike a balance
between processes and agreed upon standards vs. the wild west where everyone do
as they see fit. The governance model is intended to allow that people
progressively take larger and larger responsibilities with support from the
existing leadership.

These following sections define the different roles and responsibilities in the
project, define how decisions are taken and how people are appointed to
different roles. Overall, we expect every person who participates in the
project to adhere to our :ref:`code-of-conduct`.

.. note::

    The currrent governance model puts in words how the collaboration currently
    works in practice today and sets a basic framework for  how we collaborate
    and take decisions in the project.

    If the nature of the community or contributors changes this governance
    model may be reviewed and changed if necessary.

Roles and responsibilities
--------------------------
The *product manager*, *coordinators*, *architects* and *maintainers* (as
defined below) make up the leadership of WEKO3. The leaders of WEKO3 are
**service people** who:

- take an active role in driving the project forward,
- help newcomers as well as long-time contributors have great
  experience contributing to WEKO3,
- help train members to progressive take larger responsibility in the project,
- are role models for the remaining community.

**Roles:**

* **Members**: Anyone using WEKO3.
* **Contributors**: Anyone contributing to WEKO3 (in it widest possible
  interpretation, i.e. not only programmers).
* **Maintainers**: Anyone maintaining at least one repository. Maintainers are
  responsible for managing the issues and/or the code base of a repository
  according to WEKO3's standards.
* **Architects**: Anyone maintaining 20+ repositories (though max 10 people).
  Architects are responsible for the overall WEKO3 technical architecture as
  well as managing and training maintainers on their respective repositories.
* **Coordinators**: Representatives of WEKO3 based services that would like
  to coordinate their WEKO3 development efforts with other services and
  provide input on the product road map.
* **Product manager**: Overall responsible for WEKO3's vision, strategy and
  day-to-day management. Responsible for managing and training architects and
  coordinators.

Commit access on repositories are given to contributors, maintainers and
architects. Contributors can commit/merge to feature branches while only
maintainers and architects can commit/merge to master/maintenance branches
(meaning also only they can release packages to PyPI and NPM).

Decision making
---------------
We strive to take decisions openly and by consensus, though ultimately
National Institute of Informatics represented by the WEKO3 product
manager has the final say on all decisions in the project.
In particular this means that there is no formal voting procedure for WEKO3.

**Leaders drive decision making**

The WEKO3 product manager, architects, coordinators and maintainers as the
leaders of the project are responsible for driving decision making in their
respective domains.

Driving decision making means:

- facilitating an open constructive discussion around a decision that matches
  the level of importance and impact of a decision,
- striving for reaching consensus on a decision and ensuring relevant other
  members are aware and included on the decision,
- ensuring decisions are in alignment with the overall WEKO3 vision,
  strategy, architecture and standards,
- coordinating the decision with the WEKO3 leadership (product manager,
  architects and coordinators),
- taking the decision.

**Leaders implement decisions**

Leaders are responsible for following up decisions they take by actual
implementation. Decision should not be considered final unless it is
actually implemented or documented publicly.

**Disagreements**

Leaders of the project should always strive for consensus. If that is not
possible the leader taking a decision should alert the WEKO3 product manager
prior to taking the decision.

Members who are disagreeing with a decision may ask the product manager to
review a specific decision and possible change it.

Members who are disagreeing with the WEKO3 product manager may escalate the
product manager's decision to their hierarchy at National Institute of Informatics.

Appointments
------------
The WEKO3 product manager is appointed by National Institute of Informatics.
Architects, coordinators and maintainers are appointed by the WEKO3 product
manager in collaboration with existing architects and coordinators.

Maintainers are appointed by the architects (e.g. a new WEKO3 module) or
coordinators (e.g. a new special interest group).

In general, appointments are made in an informal way, and usually anyone
volunteering that have been showing commitment to the project will get
appointed. Any member can volunteer or suggest other members for roles.

**Revoking of appointed roles**

The product manager may revoke appointed roles of a member for reasons such as
(but not limitied to):

- lack of activity
- violations of the code of conduct
- repeated infringements of the contribution, style or maintainer guides.

The product manager must give a warning to the member to allow them to correct
their behavior except in severe cases. Revoking roles should be a last measure,
and only serve the purpose to ensure that WEKO3 has a healthy community and
collaboration based on our :ref:`code-of-conduct`.

Working/Interest groups
-----------------------
Working/interest groups may be set up by the product manager on request of any
group of members who wish to address a particular area of WEKO3 (say MARC21
support or research data management). Working/interest groups help coordinate
the overall vision, strategy and architecture of a specific area of WEKO3.
Each working/interest group must have chair that reports to the product
manager.
